<h2 id="before-the-processors">Before the processors</h2>

<h4 id="before-1945">Before 1945</h4>

<p>The processing systems were mainly mechanical.
The machines could perform the elementary operations.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century programmable machines were born, that is processing systems that could automate a process based on the user&rsquo;s requests.</p>

<p>In the 1940s we switched to relays that represented the 0/1 binary numbers but still had mechanical parts</p>

<p>An example of a mechanical calculator can be found bellow

 </div>
</p>

<h4 id="from-45-to-75">From 45 &lsquo;to 75&rsquo;</h4>

<p>Commercial production of machines based on vacuum tubes begins, but they are very simple and require the use of machine language (strictly dependent on the machine).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor" title="Definition of transistor">transistor</a> appears : smaller, more economical and faster.
High-level languages begin to appear.</p>

<h4 id="moore-theory">Moore theory</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The maximum number of transistors that can be integrated on a single circuit doubles every <sup>18</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From 1971 the evolution of the processors continued unabated up until and today.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="federico-faggin">Federico Faggin</h2>

<p><img src="/img/federico_faggin.jpeg" alt="Federico-Logo" /></p>

<p>Born in Vicenza in 1941, he is an Italian-born physicist, inventor and entrepreneur.</p>

<p>He participated in the program for the creation of the Intel 4004 and its successors. He was also the developer of MOS, a technology that allowed the creation of the first EPROM and RAM processors and memories.</p>

<p>In 74 ’he founded and directed the Zilog, a company specialized in the production of microprocessors.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>

<p>With the passage of time the evolution of the processors progressed more and more until reaching the very performing ones today and able to execute numerous complex instructions.</p>

<p>They are capable of performing up to 5000 operations per second, the equivalent of 5Ghz and with a number of cores ranging from 2 to 32, that is &ldquo;the parts of the processor&rdquo; that can perform multiple operations simultaneously.</p>

<p>The two companies that compete the most in this sector are Amd and Intel, which have been creating processors for over 30 years.
Although they were founded at a year of difference, both can produce excellent processors (In our opinion, Intel does them better 😆)</p>

<h2 id="intel">Intel</h2>

<p><img src="/img/intel-meet.jpg" alt="Intel-CES-Image" /></p>

<p>La <strong>Intel Corporation</strong> is a US company founded in 1968 with headquarters in Santa Clara (California)</p>

<p>It currently produces semiconductor devices, microprocessors, network components, chipsets for motherboards (motherboards), chips for video cards and many other integrated circuits, and is considered one of the most important in the industry.</p>

<h2 id="amd">Amd</h2>

<p><img src="/img/amd-meet.jpg" alt="Amd-Image" /></p>

<p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (abbreviated AMD) is a US semiconductor manufacturer based in Sunnyvale, California. It is one of the world leaders in the production of CPUs for the consumer market, workstations and servers; of integrated and discrete graphics chips after merging with ATI as well as chipset.</p>

<p>It ranks second in the world in the production of microprocessors with x86 architecture after Intel; while in the production of graphic chips in August 2015 it is in third position (with a market share of 10.7%) preceded by Intel (75.2%) and NVIDIA (14.1%). In 2009, AMD ranked ninth among semiconductor manufacturers in terms of annual revenue</p>
